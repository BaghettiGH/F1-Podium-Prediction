# F1 Podium Prediction
A Streamlit web application that predicts if a driver will finish on the podium (1st,2nd, or 3rd Place) in a Formula 1 Grand Prix Race using their qualifying times and initial position. This application performs **EDA**, **Data Preprocessing**, and **Supervised Machine Learning** to predict instances using **Logistic Regression**.

### 📊 Dataset:
- [Formula 1 World Championship (1950 - 2024)(Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020)
This repository serves as a project guide template for my students in **Introduction to Data Science** course for their final project. It contains a Python file `dashboard_template.py` which contains a boilerplate for a Streamlit dashboard.
### 📖 Pages:

1. `Dataset` - Brief description of the Formula 1 Dataset used in this dashboard.
2. `EDA` - Exploratory Data Analysis of the F1 Dataset. Highlights relationship of initial positionl, qualifying times and finishing on the podium. Includes bar graphs,histogram, scatter graph, etc.
3. `Data Cleaning / Pre-processing` - Data cleaning and pre-processing steps such as encoding the species column and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. `Machine Learning` - Training Logistic Regression model. This page also includes the model evaluation, feature importance and classification report.
5. `Prediction` - Prediction page where users can input values to predict if the driver will finish on the podium.
6. `Conclusion` - Summary of the insights and observations from the EDA and model training.

### 💡 Findings / Insights
